      <h2>Legal Considerations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Psilocybin-containing mushrooms are scheduled or controlled in many countries. Verify national and regional laws before collecting.</li>
        <li>Private land requires owner permission. Public lands often prohibit removal of fungi.</li>
        <li>Transporting fresh specimens across borders can trigger criminal penalties.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="info-card">
      <h2>Collection Practices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a clean, breathable container such as a paper bag to prevent condensation.</li>
        <li>Document habitat and take photographs for later verification by experienced mycologists.</li>
        <li>Avoid harvesting in areas treated with pesticides or livestock wormers.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="info-card">
      <h2>Drying &amp; Storage</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Spread thin layers over food-safe dehydrator trays set below 40&nbsp;°C to preserve psilocybin.</li>
        <li>Store thoroughly dried mushrooms in airtight containers with desiccant packs, away from light and heat.</li>
        <li>Label containers clearly and keep out of reach of children and pets.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="info-card">
      <h2>Harm Reduction</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Never consume unidentified mushrooms. Seek second opinions from credible field guides or community experts.</li>
        <li>Individuals with mental health conditions or cardiovascular issues should abstain without medical supervision.</li>
        <li>Have a trusted, sober sitter present if ingestion occurs; start with very low amounts due to high potency.</li>
      </ul>
